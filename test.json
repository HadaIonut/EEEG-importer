Affairs are handled by <span class=\"tip\" id=\"leader\"> <a class=\"link-internal macro-link\" tabindex=\"0\">The Consulate of Lords</a></span>, the head of whom is Ms <span class=\"tip\" id=\"8160cd0d-5afd-4473-9592-8801f15f4411\"> <a class=\"link-internal macro-link\" tabindex=\"0\">Alina Holt</a></span><br><h4>Economics</h4>Trade in Allaglod is mostly free, with some taxes applied to goods and services rendered in the city. People live a poor existence because of it. Welfare is average. Citizens can find an education, provided they can pay for it. Healthcare is overtaxed and underfunded, and the government hides behind layers of bureaucracy to dodge complaints. <h4>Law and Order</h4>The policing presence in Allaglod is more of a militia; some of the members of <span class=\"tip\" id=\"9b89613c-cec4-4e8a-9434-dab7acf74d21\"> <a class=\"link-internal macro-link\" tabindex=\"0\">The Officers of Dagger</a></span> are part time, and there is little need for the use of force outside of intruders. Law in Allaglod is punitive, and those that breach the laws can expect hard labor, incarceration, fines, or, in rare instances, execution.
